Gills is a 2 oscillator mono synth with amp and filter envelopes, as well as a noise oscillator and fm oscillator.
Each oscillator can have independant octaves with three waves to choose from, with the fm synth having a scale adjustment.
There are two ADSRs, one of the amp and one for the filter, which can be toggled.
There are two filters, a hi pass and low pass, both with resonance adjustment.
